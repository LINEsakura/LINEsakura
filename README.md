## 🧠 Research Vision
> I design **intelligent and autonomous systems** that integrate reinforcement learning, reasoning, and real-world execution — bridging theoretical AI and deployable ML systems.

**Research Interests:**
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** — hierarchical control, curriculum learning, memory-augmented agents  
- **LLM-Agent Systems** — tool-use, multi-agent communication, planning via natural language  
- **ML Infrastructure & Evaluation** — reproducible experiment pipelines, scalable environment design  
- **Edge/TinyML** — efficient learning on resource-constrained devices  
- **Scientific Software Engineering** — automation for physics and quantum-lab experiments

## 🎓 Honours Project — *Multi-Agent RL Environment for LLM-Agent Simulation*
**Supervisor:** Dr. Wenda Zhou, University of Edinburgh (2025–26)  

A 2D **Minecraft-inspired environment** designed to study collaboration between RL and LLM-based agents.

**Highlights:**
- Implemented **hierarchical and memory-augmented agents** with prioritized replay and intrinsic motivation.  
- Developed **language-conditioned interfaces** enabling LLM-driven subgoal decomposition and coordination.  
- Built modular environment and benchmarking suite with **Gymnasium + PyTorch + Pygame**.  
- Investigating multi-agent curriculum design and emergent communication.  

> 🧩 *Objective:* To bridge symbolic reasoning from LLMs and adaptive behaviour from RL agents.
