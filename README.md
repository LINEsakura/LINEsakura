## Honours Project — *Multi-Agent RL Environment for LLM-Agent Simulation*
**Supervisor:** Dr. Wenda Li, University of Edinburgh (2025–26)**  

A 2D **Minecraft-inspired environment** designed to study collaboration between RL and LLM-based agents.

**Highlights:**
- Implemented **hierarchical and memory-augmented agents** with prioritized replay and intrinsic motivation.  
- Developed **language-conditioned interfaces** enabling LLM-driven subgoal decomposition and coordination.  
- Built modular environment and benchmarking suite with **Gymnasium + PyTorch + Pygame**.  
- Investigating multi-agent curriculum design and emergent communication.  

>  *Objective:* To bridge symbolic reasoning from LLMs and adaptive behaviour from RL agents.
